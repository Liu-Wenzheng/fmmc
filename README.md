## Overview
In this project, we will attempt to generate Shakespearean sonnets by training a HMM & RNN on the entire
corpus of Shakespeare’s sonnets.

## Introduction
Group members: Po-Chih Chen, Wenzheng Liu

Team name: PCCWZL

Division of labor:

Wenzheng Liu: Implemented the RNN model. Compiled part of the final report.

## Examples:

HMM

Excuse might with their meadows ignorance,\
Figure and is a thus nor this their love,\
I what with whence time’s bonds therein advance,\
And the master of those should that above.\
Thee shadows not so when i on thy hooks,\
Age with made thy thoughts although soul’s to brood,\
Hast by robbed but winged upon their looks,\
Heart’s and in heat fair whilst you hath be blood.\
This hold heat look that each wilt rich confounds,\
Of true beauty of all from more esteem,\
World live him thou with thy despised sounds,\
With a quickly pride his antique redeem.\
Whose better why sigh the love’s sympathized,\
Crests the bankrupt i loving thy devised.

RNN

shall i compare thee to a summer's day,\
thou art more lovely and more temperate,\
rough winds do shake the darling buds of may,\
and summer's lease hath all too short a date.\
sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,\
and often is his gold complexion dimmed,\
and every fair i black sometime in be are one,\
with days accents grace crushed his white.\
and time of as can own is them thy too,\
so i love to me our no day awake,\
that do the have with self the am advance,\
that torment what learning in place that female.\
when truth though suffer his their more show gift,\
since is it not say i self is you.
